## Tutorial NumPy

NumPy targets the [CPython](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPython "CPython") reference [implementation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language_implementation "Programming language implementation") of Python, which is a non-optimizing [bytecode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bytecode "Bytecode") interpreter. Mathematical algorithms written for this version of Python often run much slower than [compiled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler "Compiler") equivalents. NumPy address the slowness problem partly by providing multidimensional arrays and functions and operators that operate efficiently on arrays, requiring rewriting some code, mostly inner loops using NumPy.
NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
